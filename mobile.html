								<h3>Project Revenge</h3>
							</span>
							So what is "Project Revenge"?
							<br />
							It is a complete rewrite of the popular "TotalFreedomMod" developed by Madgeek1450 (Steven Lawson) and Prozza (DarthSalamon) for the TotalFreedom Minecraft Server. You can read more about it <a href="https://github.com/TotalFreedom/TotalFreedomMod">here</a>.
							<br />
							<br />
							Project Revenge's goal is to fulfill the same basic capabilities that TotalFreedomMod has but also to expand on the features to improve stability and fuctionality.
